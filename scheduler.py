###To start, we should focus on being able to fill quotas for doctors and PAs.
###We could possibly use the same algo for doctors and PAs, but it might be easier to have two seperate
###algorithms for each as they have different variable constraints

def main():
    # This program tries to find an optimal assignment of nurses to shifts
    # (3 shifts per day, for 7 days), subject to some constraints (see below).
    # Each nurse can request to be assigned to specific shifts.
    # The optimal assignment maximizes the number of fulfilled shift requests.

    #These can be user defined variables that will be saved.
    ###Also include places where the days can be split up, such as 8 hour shifts during weekdays and 12 hour during weekends.
    ###Could ask for which days have how many x hour shifts and can be calculated after that.
    ###IMPORTANT: Keep track of the # of weeks in a month and how the weeks are filled. 
    num_nurses = 5
    num_shifts = 3
    num_days = 7
    all_nurses = range(num_nurses)
    all_shifts = range(num_shifts)
    all_days = range(num_days)

    ###This could be expanded to go from 0 - 10, 0 being no request, and 10 being a high priority request/ non-negotiable
    ##Also user definable
    shift_requests = [[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1],
                       [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]],
                      [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0],

    # min_shifts_assigned is the largest integer such that every nurse can be
    # assigned at least that number of shifts.
    ###Depending on constraints, nurses might not have to work a certain amount of shifts,
    ###Here would be a good place to instead track if a nurse has made a quoto or not, and ajust the schedule accordingly
